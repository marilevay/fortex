# ForTex

If you're regularly typing equations in an external platform and ending up with clunky plain text, this extension is for you!

ForTex adds a flexible LaTeX formula button to Quill-based text editors. It was first developed for Minerva University's classroom platform and now can be adapted to work with any Quill editor so you can easily typeset equations and mathematical expressions.

## Key features
* Add a LaTeX formula button to supported Quill-based text editors
* Type LaTeX code (similar to Overleaf) and insert rendered formulas directly into the editor
* Use standard LaTeX syntax for equations, symbols, and expressions
* Designed to work smoothly with pre-class work and breakout-style editors on Minerva’s classroom platform, but can be adapted to other Quill environments.

## How to install

## Privacy and data:
* ForTex runs only on pages that match the configured URLs (Quill-based editors).
