# ForTex Privacy Policy

Last updated: 2025-12-21

## Overview
ForTex is a Chrome extension that adds a LaTeX formula button and related behavior to Quill rich text editors on websites the user chooses to enable.

## Data We Collect
ForTex does **not** collect, sell, or share personal data.

## Data Stored Locally
ForTex stores limited settings **locally in your browser** using Chrome extension storage, such as:
- A list of websites where you enabled ForTex (allowed sites)

This information is used only to make the extension work (so you do not have to re-enable it every time).

## Data Sharing / Transmission
ForTex does **not** transmit your settings, browsing history, or page content to any external servers.

## Website Content Access
When enabled on a site, ForTex needs access to that site in order to detect Quill editors and insert/render LaTeX formulas in the editor.
ForTex does not attempt to read unrelated page content. It operates only on the Quill editor elements needed to provide its functionality.

## Remote Code
ForTex does not download or execute remote code. All extension logic is packaged with the extension.
